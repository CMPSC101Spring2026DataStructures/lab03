# Assignment: Extra Challenge

## Overview

Create a small project of your choice that uses two or three module files to run (or more modules, if you want!). For this, think of a program where each module file handles some specific part of the whole process and is integrated into the project in some meaningful way. 

For instance a mathematical program that plots data loaded from files might have three components, in addition to the file that controls their involvement.

- `main.py`: Driver for the code, works with parameters from user interactions
  - `data_loader.py` : Used to load the data
  - `analyzer.py`: Performs treatment of data and computing of outputs
  - `plotter.py`: Creates plotting the data, saves the plots as files.

 Note: While your project does not have to be as complicated as the above example, your code could still use module files (and modular designing) in its own way to complete necessary tasks, and to make its code more "readable".

## Introduce your idea

TODO

### What problem does the code address?

TODO

### Describe how the code works

In terms of inputs and outputs, how does your code function?

TODO

### Files

Please list each source code file and offer a description about what role(s) the file plays for the project.

TODO

### Additional files

Are there any additional files which are necessary to use the code?

TODO

### Anything to declare at run-time?

Please discuss any parameters to run the code. For instance, if there is a file to add as a parameter, then discuss how to engage the file from the command line.

### Executing the code

What is the command to execute the code? If there are parameters involved, then please show cases for using each of these parameters.

TODO

### Output

Please include a sample output of your code.

# Assignment: Prime Finder

## Overview

Write a program that finds all prime numbers up to a given number N. Practice using loops, functions, and conditionals.

## Instructions

- Complete the To-Dos in the provided code files.
- Your program should:
  - Prompt the user for a number N.
  - Find and print all prime numbers up to N.

## Files to Edit

- `main.py`: Handles user input and output.
- `prime_utils.py`: Contains the function to check for primes.

## Hints

- A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
- Use a helper function to check if a number is prime.
- Use `input()` to get the upper limit N.
- Write a function to check if a number is prime.
- Use a `for` loop to check each number from 2 to N.
- Print each prime number found.
- Count the total number of primes and print it at the end.
